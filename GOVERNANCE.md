# Project Governance

## Roles

- Maintainers: review/merge PRs, triage issues, publish releases
- Contributors: propose changes via PRs and issues

## Decision Making

- Small changes: maintainer approval (1+)
- Significant changes (architecture, major UI revamps): open an RFC issue for discussion and consensus

## Releases

- Changes are merged to `main`
- Releases are cut as needed; changelog is generated from PR titles

## Onboarding Maintainers

- New maintainers are nominated by existing maintainers and approved by consensus.
